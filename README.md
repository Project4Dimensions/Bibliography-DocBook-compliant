# eXist-db projects

This repository hosts projects designed for eXist-db, a NoSQL document database and application platform. Download eXist-db (http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html) or see it on GitHub (https://github.com/eXist-db/exist).

At present, there is one bibliography project distributed as a XAR package. Upload it using the eXist-db Dashboard Packet Mangager (usually http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/index.html). See the section on “Uploading Your Own packages” (http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/dashboard.xml) for information on uploading XAR packages.

The bibliography project (biblio-pt.xar) has a Portugues language interface. One in English (biblio-en.xar) will be available shortly.

The present interface allows for the creation of new entries and the ability to query the bibliography by author surname, year and title.

There are 36 sample entries. The code was developed to  power a webapp for the bibliography about the Serra da Capivara, Piauí, Brazil. It is documented in an article entitled, “Behind a ‘NoSQL’ approach in the development of a bibliography ‘captabase’ for rupestrian imagery” (see pages 143–150,  http://issuu.com/fbaul/docs/alteribi1/143).
