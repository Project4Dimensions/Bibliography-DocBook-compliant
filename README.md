# eXist-db projects

This repository hosts projects designed for the eXist-db, a NoSQL document database and application platform (see https://github.com/eXist-db/exist and http://exist-db.org).

At present, there is one bibliography project distributed as a xar package that can be imported by eXist-db, which can be downloaded at http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html

See http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/dashboard.xml (Uploading Your Own Packages) for information on uploading xar packages.

The bibliography project (biblio-pt.xar) has a Portugues language interface. One in English (biblio-pt.xar) will be available shortly.

The present interface allows for the creation of new entries and the ability to query the bibliography by author, year and title.

There are 36 sample entries. The code was initially developed to  power a webapp entitled “Bibliography of the Serra da Capivara, Piauí, Brazil”, which is documented in an article, “Behind a ‘NoSQL’ approach in the development of a bibliography ‘captabase’ for rupestrian imagery” (see pages 143–150,  http://issuu.com/fbaul/docs/alteribi1/17?e=0/8704107).
